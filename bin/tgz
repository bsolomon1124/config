#     -c/--create: Create a new archive containing the specified items
#     -f/--file: Read the archive from or write the archive to the specified file
#     -t/--list: List archive contents to stdout
#     -x/--extract: Extract to disk from the archive
#     -v/--verbose: List each file name as it is read from or written to the archive
#     -z/--gzip: Compress the resulting archive with gzip

# Creates an archive (*.tar.gz) from given directory/file. The name of the archive
# is optional and will be the directory/file name plus extension if not provided.
# Usage: tgz /path/to/dir-or-file [name-of-archive.tar.gz]
